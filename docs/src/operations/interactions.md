# Transmission Between Field Representations

In this chapter we investigate how we can model the interaction (or transmission) between two field representations.

To be able to evaluate the interaction, at least one of the field representations must be of a radiating type, such that it can meaningfully represent an antenna in transmit mode. By inferring reciprocity, we can calculate which signal such an antenna would receive when illuminated by a given incident field. 

The second field representation type must be either representing an incident field or a radiating field (in which case an incident field at the receive antenna location can be calculated from the radiating field type). 

All possible interactions between field types are listed below.
